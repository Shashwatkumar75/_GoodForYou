            <p> <strong>Starbucks</strong></p>
            <p>Have you ever wondered how Starbucks can open three branches on the same street and not have their business suffer?<br>

                The coffeehouse behemoth uses big data to determine the potential success of each new location, taking information on location, traffic, area demographic and customer behaviour into account.<br>
                
                Making this kind of assessment before opening a store means Starbucks can make a fairly accurate estimation of what the success rate will be and choose locations based on the propensity toward revenue growth.</p>

            <p><strong>Netflix</Strong></p>
            <p>The entertainment streaming service has a wealth of data and analytics providing insight into the viewing habits of millions of international consumers.<br><br>

                Netflix uses this data to commission original programming content that appeals globally as well as purchasing the rights to films and series boxsets that they know will perform well with certain audiences.<br><br>
                
                For example, Adam Sandler has proven unpopular in the US and UK markets in recent years but Netflix green-lighted four new films with the actor in 2015, armed with the knowledge that his previous work had been successful in Latin America.</p>

          	<p><strong>American Express</strong></p>
            <p>The American Express Company is using big data to analyse and predict consumer behaviour.<br>

                By looking at historical transactions and incorporating more than 100 variables, the company employs sophisticated predictive models in place of traditional business intelligence-based hindsight reporting.<br>
                
                This allows a more accurate forecast of potential churn and customer loyalty. In fact, American Express has claimed that, in their Australian market, they are able to predict 24% of accounts that will close within four months.</p>

            <p><strong>General Electric </strong></p>
          <p>GE is using the data from sensors on machinery like gas turbines and jet engines to identify ways to improve working processes and reliability.<br>

            The resultant reports are then passed to GE's analytics team to develop tools and improvements for increased efficiency.<br>
            
            The company has estimated that data could boost productivity in the US by 1.5%, which, over a 20-year period, could save enough cash to raise average national incomes by as much as 30%</p>
