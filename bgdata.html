  <span style="color:crimson;font-weight:bold;font-size:35px;">Big Data</span> is a buzzword that has been tossed around a lot lately, but it has also become big business. More than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every day, and someone has to collect, store, secure and analyze all of it. Because of this rapid growth, the job market for big data is wide open.
Jobs in almost every industry require big data specialists. There are options in IT, finance, law enforcement, government, manufacturing, farming, retail, science, medicine, and technical services. Whether your interests lie in security and software development or even data management and storage, there is something to fit your skills and job preferences.

<p>Big data  describes the large volume of data – both structured and unstructured – that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis. But it’s not the amount of data that’s important. It’s what organizations do with the data that matters. Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business moves.Big data is a big deal for industries. The onslaught of IoT and other connected devices has created a massive uptick in the amount of information organizations collect, manage and analyze. Along with big data comes the potential to unlock big insights – for every industry, large to small.</p>

<p>
The act of accessing and storing large amounts of information for analytics has been around a long time. But the concept of big data gained momentum in the early 2000s when industry analyst Doug Laney articulated the now-mainstream definition of big data as the three V’s:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Volume:</b> Organizations collect data from a variety of sources, including business transactions, smart (IoT) devices, industrial equipment, videos, social media and more. In the past, storing it would have been a problem – but cheaper storage on platforms like data lakes and Hadoop have eased the burden.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>Variety:</b> Data comes in all types of formats – from structured, numeric data in traditional databases to unstructured text documents, emails, videos, audios, stock ticker data and financial transactions.</p>
</p></li>

<li><p><b>Velocity:</b> With the growth in the Internet of Things, data streams in to businesses at an unprecedented speed and must be handled in a timely manner. RFID tags, sensors and smart meters are driving the need to deal with these torrents of data in near-real time.
</p></li>
</ul>
