            <p><strong>Airbnb </strong>– Using Data to Make Stays More Comfortable</p>
          <p>Airbnb uses data to provide better search results to its customers. It makes use of demographic analytics to analyze bounce rates from their websites. In 2014, Airbnb found out that users from certain countries would click the neighborhood link, browse the page and photos and not make any booking. <br>In order to mitigate this issue, Airbnb released a different version for the users from those countries and replaced neighborhood links with the top travel destinations. </p>

            <p> <strong>Spotify </strong>– Revolutionizing Music Streaming</p>
          <p>In the year 2017, Spotify used data science to gain insights about which universities had the highest percentage of party playlists and which ones spent the most time on it. It publishes its findings on their page “Spotify Insights” to provide information about the ongoing trends in the music. Also, in the same year, Spotify purchased Niland, which is an API based product that uses machine learning to provide better searches and recommendations to its users.</p>

          <p><strong>Amazon</Strong> – Transforming E-commerce with Data Science</p>
          <p>Amazon has an anticipatory shipping model that uses big data for predicting the products that are most likely to be purchased by its users. It analyzes the pattern of your purchases and sends products to your nearest warehouse which you may utilize in the future. Amazon also optimizes the prices on its websites by keeping in mind various parameters like the user activity, order history, prices offered by the competitors, product availability, etc. Using this method, Amazon provides discounts on popular items and earns profits on less popular items.</p>

            <p>Facebook makes use of advanced technology in data science called deep learning. Using deep learning, Facebook makes use of facial recognition and text analysis. In facial recognition, Facebook uses powerful neural networks to classify faces in the photographs. It uses its own text understanding engine called “DeepText” to understand user sentences. It also uses Deep Text to understand people’s interest and aligning photographs with texts.</p>

              <p><strong>Uber</strong> – Using Data to Make Rides Better</p>
            <p>Uber makes the best use of data science to calculate its surge pricing. When there are less drivers available to more riders, the price of the ride goes up. This happens only during the scarcity of drivers in any given area. However, if the demand for Uber rides is less, then Uber charges a lower rate. This dynamic pricing is rooted in Big Data and makes excellent usage of data science to calculate the fares based on the parameters.</p>
